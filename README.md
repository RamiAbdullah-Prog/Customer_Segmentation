---

![Project Overview](Customer_Segmentation_Image.jpg)


#### **1. Project Introduction:**
The primary objective of this project is to apply unsupervised learning techniques, specifically the **K-Means clustering algorithm**, to segment customers based on their credit card usage behaviors. This segmentation will enable the bank’s marketing team to develop more personalized and effective marketing strategies. By identifying groups of customers with similar behaviors, the bank can tailor offers, promotions, and discounts to these segments.  
Using **K-Means** combined with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction, the project aims to cluster customers based on their spending habits, credit usage, and payment patterns. This approach will help the bank optimize marketing efforts, reduce resource wastage, and increase the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.

#### **2. Project Objectives:**
The main objectives of this project are:
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segmenting customers based on their credit card usage behaviors such as balance, transactions, payments, credit limit, etc.
- **Clustering Using K-Means:** Applying **K-Means clustering** to group customers with similar behaviors.
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:** Using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of the data and enhance cluster visualization.
- **Marketing Insights:** Providing actionable insights to the bank’s marketing team on how to more effectively target different customer groups.

#### **3. Available Dataset:**
The dataset consists of information about **8950 active credit card holders** with 18 variables related to their credit card usage over a certain period.  
**Key features** in the dataset include:

- **CUST_ID:** Unique identifier for each customer (text field).
- **BALANCE:** Current balance on the credit card.
- **BALANCE_FREQUENCY:** Frequency of balance updates.
- **PURCHASES:** Total amount spent by the customer during the given period.
- **ONEOFF_PURCHASES:** Amount spent on one-time purchases.
- **INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES:** Amount spent on installment purchases.
- **CASH_ADVANCE:** Amount of cash withdrawn from the credit card.
- **PURCHASES_FREQUENCY:** Frequency of purchases made by the customer.
- **ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY:** Frequency of one-off purchases.
- **PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY:** Frequency of installment purchases.
- **CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY:** Frequency of cash advances.
- **CASH_ADVANCE_TRX:** Number of cash advance transactions.
- **PURCHASES_TRX:** Number of purchase transactions.
- **CREDIT_LIMIT:** Total credit limit of the customer.
- **PAYMENTS:** Total payments made by the customer.
- **MINIMUM_PAYMENTS:** Minimum payments (some missing values).
- **PRC_FULL_PAYMENT:** Percentage of full payments made.
- **TENURE:** Number of months the customer has had the credit card.

**Notes:**
- There are some missing values in the **CREDIT_LIMIT** and **MINIMUM_PAYMENTS** columns, which will be handled during the preprocessing stage.

#### **4. Methodology:**

**Stage 1: Data Exploration (EDA):**
- **Visualization:** Use histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Handle missing values in **CREDIT_LIMIT** and **MINIMUM_PAYMENTS** using imputation techniques or deletion.
- **Outlier Detection:** Use box plots and scatter plots to detect outliers in key features like **balance**, **purchases**, and **payments**, and treat them appropriately.

**Stage 2: Data Preprocessing:**
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values in **CREDIT_LIMIT** and **MINIMUM_PAYMENTS** will be handled using mean imputation or deletion based on the analysis.
- **Data Scaling:** Since **K-Means** is sensitive to the scale of the data, we will **standardize** the data using **StandardScaler**.
- **Feature Removal:** The **CUST_ID** column will be removed as it is not relevant for clustering.

**Stage 3: Clustering Using K-Means:**
- **Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters (K):** We will use the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
  - **Elbow Method:** This method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different values of K and identifying the "elbow" point where the improvement starts to slow.
  - **Silhouette Score:** Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher score indicates better clustering.
- **Applying K-Means Clustering:** After determining the optimal K, we will apply the **K-Means** algorithm to segment the customers.

**Stage 4: Dimensionality Reduction Using PCA:**
- **PCA:** **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** will be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 2 or 3 dimensions for easier visualization and interpretation of the clusters.
- **Visualization:** We will visualize the clusters in a 2D space using the first two principal components.

**Stage 5: Post-Clustering Analysis:**
- **Cluster Profiling:** After clustering, we will analyze the centroids of each cluster to understand the main characteristics of customers in each group.
  - Example: Cluster 1 may have customers with high credit usage but low payments, Cluster 2 may have low credit usage with frequent payments, and so on.
- **Actionable Insights:** Based on the characteristics of each cluster, we will provide recommendations to the marketing team on how to tailor promotional strategies for each group.

#### **5. Proposed Models and Techniques:**

- **K-Means Clustering:** This unsupervised learning algorithm will be used to identify clusters of customers based on their behavior.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** To reduce dimensionality and visualize clusters in a 2D or 3D space.
- **Elbow Method and Silhouette Score:** These techniques will help determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.

---

#### **6. Tools and Technologies Used:**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
  - **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
  - **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib:** For visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models (K-Means, PCA, StandardScaler).
- **Techniques:** **Unsupervised Learning**, **Clustering**, **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**.

---

#### **7. Expected Outcomes:**
- **Customer Segmentation:** Customers will be grouped into clusters with similar behaviors, providing the bank with a deeper understanding of their customer base.
- **Actionable Marketing Insights:** Based on the clusters, we will provide the marketing team with recommendations on how to target each group more effectively.
- **Visualizations:** Clear visualizations (e.g., PCA plots, cluster profiles) will help the team in decision-making.

---

#### **8. Potential Challenges:**
- **Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters (K):** Selecting the right number of clusters using methods like the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** may be challenging and require careful evaluation.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Ensuring proper handling of missing values without losing important information can be tricky.
- **Interpreting Clusters:** Interpreting the characteristics of each cluster might be challenging, especially without domain knowledge.

---

#### **9. Conclusion:**
This project will leverage **unsupervised learning techniques**, particularly **K-Means clustering**, to segment customers based on their credit card usage behavior. By identifying clusters with similar characteristics, the bank will be able to allocate its marketing resources more efficiently and develop more effective promotional strategies, ultimately improving the success of marketing campaigns and increasing profitability.
